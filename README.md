  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I always knew that I was fascinated by the social power of web/app services. It made ideas come true and solved actual problems, and it just looked 'cool'. I gradually started to learn how to do it, defied my limits, and eventually morphed into selecting 'web development' as a career. I am obsessed with learning something new every day, and love new challenges that is put in front of me.
