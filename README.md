  <summary><b>✨&nbsp;More&nbsp;About&nbsp;Me</b></summary>
  <br/>
  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am currently studying Full Stack Web development. Most of my leisure time is being spent on developing new web projects. Most of the projects I think of are meant to tackle problems that came up in recent years. I consider my strength as 'QQQ; Quick problem detection, Quick planning, and Quick development'.  
  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I always new that I was fascinated by the social power of web/app services. It made ideas come true and solved actual problems, and it just looked 'cool'. I gradually started to learn how to do it, defied my limits, and eventually morphed into selecting 'web development' as a career. I am obsessed with learning something new every day, and love new challenges that is put in front of me.
  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What problems do I most care about? I believe that Software Development is all about 'automation'. Computers are things that we humans can control. We can make computers take care of tedious procedures, making our lives more comfortable and do more creative stuff. Unfortunately, there are still lots of work that are waiting for automation. Wouldn't it be great if all of us can collaborate, discover problems, and enhance processes which can make everyones lives better?
